G2 Simple TDD automatic file parser for C language
=

This is a simple parser, which delivers basic TDD functionality for C programming language.

All you need to do is compile the "main.c", including the "tdd.h" file. Then you can run the parser, specifying testing source files as parameters.

A testing source file is simple C source file, but can have TDD tags in it. Check out the "t1.tst" file for reference and "t1.c" as an output from the parser. Also, the parser initially compiles each parsed test file, so that after parsing you can run tests.

Have fun hacking :)
